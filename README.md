# Asteroids
Asteroid shooter game

Asteroids (Version 4.0)
A space shooter game. The objective of the game is to destroy the incoming asteroids before they destroy your ship.
The player controls a spaceship that fires lasers. The player gains points for every asteroid destroyed and looses a life if they're hit. Asteroids continue to increase in speed and number until the player reaches zero lives.

Instructions:
  Up arrow key: Move the spaceship up
  Down arrow key: Move the spaceship down
  Spacebar: Shoot lasers
  
Programmed by Samantha Bennefield in Python 3.5 and PyGame.
Began program on 2/13/17 and finished on 3/7/17

Version 1.0:
  (2/13/17 - 2/21/17)
  Created the spaceship, lasers, asteroids, scoring system, lives, and collision.
  Problems that occured while programming Version 1.0 were difficulties in creating multiple asteroids and having them all appear on
  screen (fixed), collision between the spaceship and asteroids (fixed, but the player can occasionally still get away with
  some close calls), and finally getting the score and lives text to change (fixed).
  
Version 2.0:
  (2/23/17 - 2/24/17)
  High score and Game Over screens.
  Problems that occured while programming Version 2.0 were getting high score and game over text to appear after the game has ended 
  (Currently when the players lives reach 0 the program stops the ship and asteroids but does not display a Game Over screen).
  
Version 3.0:
  (2/27/17 - 3/1/17)
  Adding background music, asteroid explosion sound effect, laser sound sound effect, and ship explosion sound effect.
  Problems that occured while programming Version 3.0 were changing the audio file types.
  
Version 4.0 (final version):
  (3/1/17 - 3/3/17)
  Adding a start screen and power up.
  Problems that occured while programming Version 4.0 were adding a power up (There are currently still no power ups in game)
